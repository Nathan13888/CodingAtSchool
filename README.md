# Coding At School

Welcome to my repo with all the code written for school. Larger projecst will msot likely be in a separate repo but small assignments or programs will be here. Just hope that the repo won't become very messy after a while...

# Running the Programs

Depending of which language, it could be either trivial or not at all. The majority of the programs should be in either Java or C++.

## Java

Running Java is rather annoying. If possible, just copy the source file and compile into a separate jar file to run (java -jar). I'll try to provide links to already compiled Jars if I find a way to upload them...

## C++

Much easier than Java, just compile it however you like with GCC (personal choice), Clang, MSVC, etc. Then just run it...
